Welcome to Maps Printer's documentation!
============================================

**Presentation** 
............

This plugin is designed for exporting in one-click several print composers into PDF or Image file formats (.JPEG, .TIFF, .PNG, .ICO ...) 
The plugin installs a menu item (Plugins > Maps Printer) containing two items : the main button to export the print composers and the one to open this help dialog. 
It also creates a button in the plugins toolbar to open the Maps Printer main dialog.

The Maps Printer dialog offers the options to use to export many print composers simultaneously. 
Once you have designed your print composers as you wish and are ready to print them, don't waste your time on printing them one by one. 
Use Maps Printer plugin instead.

**Using Maps Printer**
............

The main window of the plugin offers the options to use. Once opened, you get a list of all print composers available in the project. To generate file(s):

#. Check the print composer(s) you wish to export

#. Choose a folder where to save the exported file(s)

#. Select the wished format of file(s)

#. And press **Export**.

So easy, right?

**Tips**
............
The "Update" button helps to add to the list new print composers that may have been created since the dialog is open. 
It also erases those that may have been deleted or renamed.

**Known limitations**
............
In the case you have more than one print composer with the same name, Maps Printer plugin will identify only one of them and generate only one export file. So avoid giving the same name to your print composers.
Don't expect dealing with atlas compositions (iterating on coverage layer). This plugin just exports the compositions as they are displayed at the screen in the project.


Thanks for trying this plugin !
